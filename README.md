# JCarousel
A JavaScript carousel class

The idea is to take a array of 5 elements or greater and cycle through it in an infinite loop only displaying 5 items at a time.
The item from the array in the center is considered the selected item on or item on display. 

This code can be run in the browser console (Only tested so far in Chrome), by copying the class in the console and then creating 
an instance of the class passing in an intial array to the constructor. Then call the next and prev methods to see the cycle work.
